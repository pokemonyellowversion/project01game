[Description]

X-Wing VS TIE Fighters 8-bit is inspired by my love of the Star Tours ride at Disneyland and retro arcade 8-bit styling. Move the player with the left and right arrows. Press spacebar to shoot. Press enter to restart the game.

[Technologies Used]

Technologies used are HTML Canvas, CSS, and Javascript. I also used GIMP 2 to edit the sprite images.

[Getting Started]

[Next Steps]

No unsolved problems as the game has full functionality. Extra features I could add are score penalties if the player fails to shoot an enemy, a boss enemy, or a start screen displaying the game instructions.
