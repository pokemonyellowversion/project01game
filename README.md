# project01game: X-WING VS TIE FIGHTERS 8-BIT

<b>[Description]</b>

X-Wing VS TIE Fighters 8-Bit is inspired by my love of the Star Tours ride at Disneyland and retro arcade 8-bit styling. Move the player with the left and right arrows. Press the down arrow to stop. Press spacebar to shoot. Press enter to restart the game.

<b>[Technologies Used]</b>

Technologies used are HTML Canvas, CSS, and Javascript. I also used GIMP 2 to edit the sprite images.

<b>[Getting Started]</b>

<b>[Next Steps]</b>

No unsolved problems as the game has full functionality. Extra features I could add are score penalties if the player fails to shoot an enemy, a boss enemy, have the enemies shoot back, or a start screen displaying the game instructions.
